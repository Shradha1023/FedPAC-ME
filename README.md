# Federated Learning Framework for Medical Image Analysis with Perspective-Aware Contrastive and Mixture of Experts (FedPAC-ME)
This repository contains the official implementation of FedPAC-ME, a federated learning framework that integrates Multi-Perspective Contrastive Learning (MPCL) with a Mixture-of-Experts (ME) personalization module to achieve robust, privacy-preserving medical image segmentation across heterogeneous clients.

The code supports federated training with labeled and unlabeled data, multi-perspective augmentations, contrastive alignment, and client-specific expert routing. It is built for reproducibility and fully aligned with the code policies of Nature Scientific Reports.
