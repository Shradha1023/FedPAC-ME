# Federated Learning Framework for Medical Image Analysis with Perspective-Aware Contrastive and Mixture of Experts (FedPAC-ME)
This repository contains the official implementation of FedPAC-ME, a federated learning framework that integrates Multi-Perspective Contrastive Learning (MPCL) with a Mixture-of-Experts (ME) personalization module to achieve robust, privacy-preserving medical image segmentation across heterogeneous clients.

The code supports federated training with labeled and unlabeled data, multi-perspective augmentations, contrastive alignment, and client-specific expert routing. It is built for reproducibility and fully aligned with the code policies of Nature Scientific Reports.

# 🧠 Overview
This repository contains the source code used to implement the FedPAC-ME framework described in the associated manuscript. The framework integrates (i) multi-perspective contrastive learning for representation alignment and (ii) a mixture-of-experts module for client-specific personalization within a federated learning environment. The codebase supports semi-supervised training using both labeled and unlabeled medical imaging data and is designed to operate under heterogeneous (non-IID) client distributions.

All experiments presented in the manuscript can be reproduced using the scripts and configuration files provided here.
